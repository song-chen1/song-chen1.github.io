  - title: Effect of Helium Ion Irradiation on Spin and Magnetic Properties of Ta/CoFeB Structures
    project_short: Research project
    project: This research investigates he effects of Helium ion irradiation on the spin and magnetic properties of Ta/CoFeB structures. The samples of Ta/CoFeB with different thicknesses of the Ta layer are deposited and annealed for PMA and then irradiated by different doses. The different thicknesses of Ta lead to different properties in microscopic, and the dose-dependent effects can show the effects of the He ion irradiation.

  - title: AutoVA - Automated VCMA & AHE Measurement System
    authors: Song Chen
    project_short: Software
    project: The software is used to 1. control the E-field applied for the VCMA/Magnetoelectric coupling; 2. to control the elctromagnetic field; 3. to control the SMU to apply one bias current ,and meanwhile measuring the Hall voltage. All the parameters can be set correspondingly and sequencer can be made to realize the automation.

  - title: Tuning of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Bi-substituted yttrium iron garnet films by He+ ion irradiation

    project_short: Research project
    project: This research investigates the effects of He+ ion irradiation on the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of Bi-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Bi:YIG) films. The samples are irradiated with different doses of He+ ions, and the effects on the magnetic properties are studied. The results show that the PMA can be tuned by He+ ion irradiation, which is important for the development of spintronic devices.
