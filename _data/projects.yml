  - title: Anomalous Hall Effect Measurement System (AHEMS)
    authors: Song Chen
    project_short: Software
    project: The software is used to obatin the AHE hysteresis loops which is based on he relationship between the anomalous Hall conductivity and an external magnetic field applied to a material.

  - title: AutoVA - Automated VCMA & AHE Measurement System
    authors: Song Chen
    project_short: Software
    project: The software is used to 1. control the E-field applied for the VCMA/Magnetoelectric coupling; 2. to control the elctromagnetic field; 3. to control the SMU to apply one bias current ,and meanwhile measuring the Hall voltage. All the parameters can be set correspondingly and sequencer can be made to realize the automation.
